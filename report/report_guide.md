This course project offers students two distinct but equally rigorous pathways to demonstrate their understanding of database systems concepts and practical skills. Students may choose one of the following two tracks:

Track 1: Database Application Development
Design and implement a full-stack application centered around a relational or non-relational database system. The application should solve a real-world problem, demonstrate efficient data modeling, support meaningful queries, and incorporate proper software and database engineering practices.

Track 2: Research Paper Replication (SIGMOD/VLDB/ICDE-style)
Select and replicate a published research paper from a top-tier database conference such as SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, or EDBT. The goal is to understand, reimplement (at least the core ideas or algorithms), and evaluate the technical contributions of the paper. This track emphasizes critical reading, systems implementation, and experimental validation.

Project Deliverables and Grading Scheme
1. Source Code (30%)
For Track 1: Submit all source code for your application, including database schema, backend logic, frontend (if applicable), and any scripts for data generation or testing.
For Track 2: Submit your implementation of the paper’s core algorithm(s) or system components, along with test scripts, synthetic/real datasets, and evaluation code.
Make an online code repo (e.g. GitHub) for all your code.
Include a clear README explaining the structure, dependencies, and how to run the code.
2. Video Demonstration (20%)
Track 1: Record a 5–8 minute screencast demonstrating key features of your application: user interface, query execution, data flow, and backend operations.
Track 2: Present a 5–8 minute video explaining the selected paper, your implementation approach, and experimental results (e.g., performance figures, correctness validation).
Use screen recording tools (e.g., OBS, Zoom, Loom) and upload the video to a file-sharing service (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive). Ensure the link is accessible.
Include the video link in your final report.
3. Written Report (50%)
Submit a comprehensive report in PDF format named XXXX-report.pdf. The report should include:

Group Information:

Names and undergraduate majors of all group members
Contribution Statement:

A clear breakdown of each member’s role and contributions
Project Overview:

For Track 1: Problem statement, application goals, and target users
For Track 2: Title, authors, and venue of the replicated paper; motivation for selection
Technical Design:

Track 1: Software architecture (e.g., MVC, microservices), technology stack, and system diagram
Track 2: Summary of the paper’s technical approach, your implementation strategy, and deviations (if any)
Database Design (Track 1) or Algorithm/System Implementation (Track 2):

Track 1: ER diagram, schema design, normalization level, indexing strategy, and sample queries
Track 2: Description of the core algorithm(s), data structures, and how you validated correctness
Evaluation and Results:

Track 1: Demonstration of query efficiency, scalability, or usability
Track 2: Experimental setup, datasets used, performance metrics, and comparison (if applicable) with original results
Challenges and Lessons Learned

References: Include the paper being replicated (for Track 2)

Additional Guidelines
Groups may consist of 3–5 students.
For Track 2, papers must be from SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, or equivalent DB venues (approval required by instructor if venue is unclear).
All code and reports must be original. Proper citation is required for any external resources or code snippets.
Late submissions will be penalized per course policy.
This project is designed to deepen your understanding of database systems through either hands-on development or rigorous scientific replication—both valuable paths in modern data management research and engineering.

Let your curiosity guide your choice, and aim for depth, clarity, and technical excellence.
